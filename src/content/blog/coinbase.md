If you use my link, you can get a extra ten dollars in crypto and I also get some crypto as well. I believe you have to buy at least a 100 dollars at one time to get the bonus, but if its your first time buying it on Coinbase then you should use Rakuten first because they will give you money back for new Coinbase users and that does help, I will talk Rakuten in another blog but feel free to reach out if anyone has any questions on how to do it. I will be posting links in other blogs and will try to see how long of blogs everyone prefers.
I will go into more details as well on passive income and stuff like that as well, but this blog I will keep short and mostly about Coinbase.

They do lack in some of the coins I like to watch. But as I have learned more I have found other options that I like and will probably talk about them in other blogs..**.**
